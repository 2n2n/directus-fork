# Creating Users

A user is an item in the `directus_users` collection. There are no required fields by default, although you may choose to require values for any system or user-created fields.

<!-- TODO: IMAGE - user detail page -->

To log in with an `email` and `password` they must be set on the user item. A user can also have a [role](/auth/access-control) and any number of policies that can be assigned in the user detail page.

## Creating Users via API

There are two ways to create users via API.

### Register API

The user registration feature is disabled by default. To make use of it, it must first be enabled via Project Settings. By enabling user registration, it is open to anyone via the Data Studio. The Register API also only supports `first_name` and `last_name` fields to be set.

```json [POST /register]
{
	"email": "hello@example.com",
	"password": "d1r3ctu5"
}
```

### Users API

The Users API can also create a new user. Any field in the `directus_users` collection can be set when creating a user, but the correct public collection permissions will be required.

```json [POST /users]
{
	"email": "hello@example.com",
	"password": "d1r3ctu5",
	"role": "c86c2761-65d3-43c3-897f-6f74ad6a5bd7"
}
```

::callout{type="api-reference" url="/api-reference/users/post/users"}
See all parameters and payload options for the create user endpoint.

## Inviting Users

Inviting a user will send an email with an invite URL. Once invited, the user will be created with the provided email address and a status of `invited`. When a user accepts their invite they must provide a password and will be able to log in.

```json [POST /users/invite]
{
	"email": "hello@example.com",
	"role": "c86c2761-65d3-43c3-897f-6f74ad6a5bd7"
}
```

::callout{type="dev-docs" url="/configuration/email"}
An email service must be configured to send invites.

### Seamless Invites

You can use the invite system within your own application ensuring users do not need to access the Data Studio.

When using the invite user endpoint, add an `invite_url` property. The invite email will use this URL instead of your Directus project, appending the invite token in the URL as a `token` parameter.

Your application must extract this value, collect the new user's password, and send both to the accept invite endpoint.

```json [POST /users/invite/accept]
{
	"token": "eyJh...KmUk",
	"password": "d1r3ctu5"
}
```

::callout{type="dev-docs" url="/configuration/security-limits"}
The `USER_INVITE_URL_ALLOW_LIST` environment variable must be configured.
